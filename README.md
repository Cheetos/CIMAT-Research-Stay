# CIMAT Research Stay

In 2012 I did a research stay at CIMAT. My research focus was Probabilistic Graphical Models, and sampling methods, specially Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. 
I worked on some projects like a face tracking program using particle filters, and Boltzmann Machines for image denoising. I had a great time doing this. I hope you like it too.
